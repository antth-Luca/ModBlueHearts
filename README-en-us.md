 # Repository: ModBlueHearts

This repository houses the mod Forge “Blue Hearts” for Minecraft. Blue hearts doesn't add much. 

I've always wanted to create a mod for Minecraft and I'm very creative, but everything has to start somehow. Taking advantage of my need to master Java, I created my first simple mod!

Take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/antth-Luca/ModBlueHearts/wiki/Home‐en‐us)

## Minecraft versions supported
* 1.18.2.

## Version features:
* v.1:
    * Blue heart: A new type of life heart that cannot be regenerated with saturation, but can be regenerated by sleeping. The damage caused to them cannot be reduced by armor. These blue hearts can be obtained by taking the Blue Blood Potion, or reset with the Orange Antidote, with a maximum of 10 and a minimum of 0 hearts.
    * Blue Blood Potion: Potion brewed with Vital Sap;
    * Orange Antidote: Brewed potion with Damage Potion and Rotten Flesh;
    * Vital sap: Goo made on the Workbench with Slime Ball, Glittering Watermelon, Soul Sand and Lapis Lazuli;
    * Commands for managing players' hearts;
    * Configuration file for the world's initial hearts.

## Future updates:
* Blue Hearts v.1 for 1.19;
* Blue Hearts v.2 for 1.19:
